# Deep Learning
Except for 02: basic deep learning techniques and 04: regression, each notebook contains the 
- **motivation**
- **math** behind the model 
- **PyTorch** implementation.

Writing these blog-like PyTorch tutorial not only enhances my coding and comprehension of these deep learning models but also helps me polish my writing  and organization ability. The code inside each mini-project is not for proving my coding ability to someone else but for cumulating my coding experiences. Hope my project provide a gentle but fruitful introduction for those who are unfamiliar with deep learning or those who know the theories but have little implmentation experiences.
