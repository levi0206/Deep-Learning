# Deep Learning
Except for 02: basic deep learning techniques and 04: regression, each notebook contains the **motivation** and **math** behind the model followed by **PyTorch** implementation. These blog-like PyTorch tutorial not only enhances my coding and comprehension of these deep learning models but also serves as my side projects.
