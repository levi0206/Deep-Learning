# Deep Learning
Except for 02: basic deep learning techniques and 04: regression, each notebook contains the **motivation** and **math** behind the model followed by **PyTorch** implementation. Writing these blog-like PyTorch tutorial not only enhances my coding and comprehension of these deep learning models but also helps me develop my writing and communucation skills that any one could follow my ideas.
